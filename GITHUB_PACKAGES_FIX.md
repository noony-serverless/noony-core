# GitHub Packages Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Configuration

- **Problem**: The publish steps were using `NOONY_NPM_TOKEN` as environment variable instead of the correct `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`
- **Fix**: Changed environment variable to `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` which is the standard for npm authentication

### 2. Token Source

- **Problem**: Using custom `NOONY_NPM_TOKEN` secret instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Fix**: Updated all workflows to use `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions

### 3. Workflow Structure

- **Problem**: The `get-version` step was defined after it was being used in the release step
- **Fix**: Moved the version extraction step before the release creation

### 4. Duplicate Step IDs

- **Problem**: Two steps had the same ID `get-version` causing workflow validation errors
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate step and properly organized the workflow sequence

### 5. Security Issue in .npmrc

- **Problem**: Hard-coded GitHub token in `.npmrc` file
- **Fix**: Replaced with environment variable placeholder `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}`

### 6. Deprecated Action

- **Problem**: Using deprecated `actions/create-release@v1`
- **Fix**: Updated to use `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` which is actively maintained

### 7. Missing Git Tag Creation

- **Problem**: Release was being created without first creating the corresponding Git tag
- **Fix**: Added step to create and push Git tag before creating the GitHub release

## Workflow Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Publishing

- Added verbose logging to show registry configuration during publish
- Added `--access public` flag to ensure proper package visibility
- Added verification step to confirm successful publication

### 2. Better Error Handling

- Added verification step that checks if the package is available after publishing
- Added debug output to show current registry configuration

## Configuration Files Updated

### `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml`

- Fixed authentication for npm publish (NODE_AUTH_TOKEN + GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Updated release creation action
- Added Git tag creation
- Added package verification
- Improved step organization and dependencies

### `.github/workflows/manual-release.yml`

- Fixed authentication for npm publish (NODE_AUTH_TOKEN + GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Updated release creation action from deprecated `actions/create-release@v1` to `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
- Added package verification step
- Enhanced publishing with verbose logging

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

- Fixed authentication for npm publish (NODE_AUTH_TOKEN + GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Updated release creation action from deprecated `actions/create-release@v1` to `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
- Updated debug messages to reflect new token usage

### `.npmrc`

- Replaced hard-coded token with environment variable
- Maintained proper registry configuration for both GitHub Packages and npm

## Usage

The workflows now properly:

1. Build the project
2. Publish to GitHub Packages with correct authentication using the default GITHUB_TOKEN
3. Bump the version and commit the change
4. Create a Git tag
5. Create a GitHub release with the new tag
6. Verify the package was published successfully

## Required Secrets

âœ… **No additional secrets required!** 

The workflows now use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions with the correct permissions due to the workflow permissions configuration:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: write
  pull-requests: write
```

## Benefits of Using GITHUB_TOKEN

1. **Automatic**: No need to create or manage custom secrets
2. **Secure**: Token is scoped to the repository and has limited lifetime
3. **Proper Permissions**: Has the right permissions for GitHub Packages when workflow permissions are set
4. **Maintenance-free**: No risk of token expiration or rotation issues

## Testing

You can test the workflows by:

1. Triggering them manually via `workflow_dispatch`
2. Checking the GitHub Packages section of your repository
3. Verifying the release was created in the Releases section

The workflows are now production-ready and follow GitHub Actions best practices!
