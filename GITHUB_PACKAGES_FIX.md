# GitHub Packages Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Configuration
- **Problem**: The publish step was using `NOONY_NPM_TOKEN` as environment variable instead of the correct `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`
- **Fix**: Changed environment variable to `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` which is the standard for npm authentication

### 2. Workflow Structure
- **Problem**: The `get-version` step was defined after it was being used in the release step
- **Fix**: Moved the version extraction step before the release creation

### 3. Duplicate Step IDs
- **Problem**: Two steps had the same ID `get-version` causing workflow validation errors
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate step and properly organized the workflow sequence

### 4. Security Issue in .npmrc
- **Problem**: Hard-coded GitHub token in `.npmrc` file
- **Fix**: Replaced with environment variable placeholder `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}`

### 5. Deprecated Action
- **Problem**: Using deprecated `actions/create-release@v1`
- **Fix**: Updated to use `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` which is actively maintained

### 6. Missing Git Tag Creation
- **Problem**: Release was being created without first creating the corresponding Git tag
- **Fix**: Added step to create and push Git tag before creating the GitHub release

## Workflow Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Publishing
- Added verbose logging to show registry configuration during publish
- Added `--access public` flag to ensure proper package visibility
- Added verification step to confirm successful publication

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Added verification step that checks if the package is available after publishing
- Added debug output to show current registry configuration

## Configuration Files Updated

### `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml`
- Fixed authentication for npm publish
- Updated release creation action
- Added Git tag creation
- Added package verification
- Improved step organization and dependencies

### `.npmrc`
- Replaced hard-coded token with environment variable
- Maintained proper registry configuration for both GitHub Packages and npm

## Usage

The workflow now properly:
1. Builds the project
2. Publishes to GitHub Packages with correct authentication
3. Bumps the version and commits the change
4. Creates a Git tag
5. Creates a GitHub release with the new tag
6. Verifies the package was published successfully

## Required Secrets

Ensure the following secret is configured in your repository:
- `NOONY_NPM_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `packages:write` permission

## Testing

You can test the workflow by:
1. Triggering it manually via `workflow_dispatch`
2. Checking the GitHub Packages section of your repository
3. Verifying the release was created in the Releases section
