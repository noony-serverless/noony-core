I'll help you find the relevant code and then create a GitHub Action workflow. Let me first explore the current workspace structure to understand the project better. I'll help you find the relevant code and structure for creating a GitHub Action to build, deploy, and bump the version. Let me explore the workspace to understand the current setup. I'll search for relevant code to understand the project structure and any existing deployment/versioning configurations.

I'll help you find all the relevant code for creating a GitHub Action to build, deploy, and bump the version. Let me explore the workspace structure and understand the current setup. I'll help you find all the relevant code for creating a GitHub Action to build, deploy, and bump the version. Let me explore the workspace to understand the current project structure and configuration. I'll create a GitHub Action workflow that builds, deploys your library to GitHub Packages, and automatically bumps the version for the next release. 

Made changes.

Let me also create a more advanced workflow that handles different types of version bumps and includes better error handling: 

Made changes.

Let me fix the changelog issue and also create a simple workflow for development purposes: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me create a simple CI workflow for pull requests and development: 

Made changes.

Now let me create a workflow specifically for manual releases with more control: 

Made changes.

Now, let me update your .npmrc file to use the proper environment variable name that GitHub Actions provides: 
```

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive GitHub Actions setup for your library with three different workflows:

## 🚀 Created Workflows

### 1. **CI Workflow** (ci.yml)
- **Triggers**: Pull requests and pushes to non-main branches
- **Purpose**: Quality assurance for development
- **Features**:
  - Tests on Node.js 18 & 20
  - Full test suite with coverage
  - Linting and formatting checks
  - Build verification
  - Package size reporting

### 2. **Automatic Release** (release.yml)
- **Triggers**: Pushes to main/master branch
- **Purpose**: Automated semantic versioning and deployment
- **Features**:
  - Auto-detects version bump type from commit messages
  - Conventional commits support (`feat:` = minor, `BREAKING CHANGE` = major)
  - Publishes to GitHub Packages
  - Creates GitHub releases
  - Automatic version bumping for next development

### 3. **Manual Release** (manual-release.yml)
- **Triggers**: Manual workflow dispatch
- **Purpose**: Controlled releases with options
- **Features**:
  - Custom version specification
  - Dry-run mode for testing
  - Pre-release option
  - Detailed release notes
  - Development version management

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### GitHub Repository Settings
1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Set **Workflow permissions** to "Read and write permissions"
3. Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### Environment Variables
The workflows use `NOONY_NPM_TOKEN` which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions.

## 📦 How to Use

### Automatic Releases
1. **Push to main branch** → Automatic release
2. **Commit message conventions**:
   - `fix: something` → patch version (0.0.4 → 0.0.5)
   - `feat: new feature` → minor version (0.0.4 → 0.1.0)
   - `feat!: breaking change` → major version (0.0.4 → 1.0.0)

### Manual Releases
1. Go to **Actions** → **Manual Release**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Choose options:
   - **Version**: `1.2.3` or `patch`/`minor`/`major`
   - **Pre-release**: For beta/alpha releases
   - **Dry run**: Test without publishing

### Example Workflow Run
```bash
# Current version: 0.0.4
# After automatic release: 0.0.5
# After version bump: 0.0.6-dev
```

## 📋 What Each Release Does

1. ✅ **Quality Checks**: Tests, linting, formatting
2. 🏗️ **Build**: TypeScript compilation + type definitions
3. 📤 **Publish**: Deploy to GitHub Packages
4. 🏷️ **Tag**: Create git tag (v0.0.5)
5. 📝 **Release**: GitHub release with changelog
6. ⬆️ **Bump**: Increment version for next development
7. 💾 **Commit**: Push version changes back to repo

## 🎯 Installation After Release

Users can install your published package:
```bash
npm install @noony-serverless/core@latest
```

The workflows are now ready to use! Push to main or manually trigger a release to see them in action.
